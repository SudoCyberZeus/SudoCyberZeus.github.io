            <h2>Fruit For Thought</h2>
            <p>
                A simple, old-school definition for marketing is that it is the creation of demand for your product or service. If all goes well, this demand should translate into sales and, ultimately, revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Digital Marketing is an umbrella term for the marketing of products or services using digital technologies, mainly on the Internet, but also including mobile phones, display advertising, and any other digital medium.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact that digital marketing is highly empirical is one of its key strengths. Everything can be measured: from behaviors to actions and action paths to results. This means that digital marketing strategist should start thinking with return on investment (ROI) in mind. Built into any strategy should be a testing framework and the ability to remain flexible in a medium that shifts and changes as user behaviors do. If we define strategy as “a plan of action designed to achieve a particular outcome”, then the desired outcome from a digital marketing strategy point of view would be aligned with your Web Presence Goals.
